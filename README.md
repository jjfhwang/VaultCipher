# VaultCipher

## Description

VaultCipher is a research project exploring decentralized ledger technologies, with a focus on cryptographic primitives, their implementations in Go, and formal verification techniques. The goal is to provide a robust and auditable foundation for building secure and trustworthy decentralized systems. This repository serves as a platform for experimenting with novel cryptographic constructions and applying formal methods to ensure their correctness and security. VaultCipher aims to contribute to the advancement of decentralized ledger technology by offering well-vetted and formally verified cryptographic components. It is intended to be a resource for researchers, developers, and anyone interested in the intersection of cryptography and decentralized systems. The project emphasizes clarity, security, and performance in its implementations.

## Features

*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Implementations of various zero-knowledge proof systems, including Bulletproofs and zk-SNARKs, with a focus on efficiency and security. These proofs allow for the verification of statements without revealing the underlying secret.
*   **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Provides cryptographic protocols for secure computation among multiple parties, enabling collaborative computation without revealing individual inputs. Includes implementations of secret sharing schemes and secure aggregation techniques.
*   **Formal Verification:** Employs formal methods, such as model checking and theorem proving, to rigorously verify the correctness and security properties of cryptographic implementations. Uses tools like ProVerif and Dafny to provide assurance against vulnerabilities.
*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Implements threshold signature schemes and threshold encryption, enabling distributed key management and fault tolerance. These schemes allow multiple parties to jointly control a cryptographic key, requiring a threshold number of participants to authorize operations.
*   **Cryptographic Primitives:** Offers a collection of fundamental cryptographic building blocks, including hash functions, symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, and digital signature schemes. Optimized for performance and security.
